Discord Audio Redirect Pulseaudio Stream

A workaround to streaming desktop audio alongside video in Discord video streaming.

This is a workaround, albeit very hacky, but a workaround, none-the-less.

This allows any linux-based user also using PulseAudio to ~~sacrifice their microphone to the gods~~ bind audio sinks (desktop audio) to audio sources (a microhpone), thereby allowing users to stream their desktop audio alongside a video stream.
